# Implementation for the study: A multi-agent model of urban microgrids: Assessing the effects of energy-market shocks using real-world data
based on work done during the FIM individual research phase in fall 2022 at Research Center Finance & Information Management, Branch Business & Information Systems Engineering of the Fraunhofer FIT.

This code implements an agent-based model to simulate residential smart home behavior with peer-to-peer trading.


The agent-based simulation leverages the mesa library, and the smart home energy management system (HEMS) optimization is implemented in Python Gurobi interface gurobipy.

The underlying data is proprietary and not uploaded.
